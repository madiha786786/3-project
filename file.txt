2. Create a New Freestyle Project

In Jenkins, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project and give it a name (e.g., MyJavaAppBuild).

Click OK.

3. Configure Source Code Management

Under Source Code Management, select Git (or your preferred version control system).

Enter the repository URL of your Java web application project.

If necessary, provide credentials for the repository.

4. Add Build Step to Invoke Maven

Under Build, click Add build step.

Select Invoke top-level Maven targets.

In the Goals field, type clean install (or your desired Maven goals).

Make sure the Maven version is correct (you may need to configure the Maven installation in Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration).

5. Configure Post-build Actions (Optional)

If you want to archive the build artifacts, click Add post-build action.

Select Archive the artifacts and specify the path to the .war file (e.g., target/*.war).

6. Save & Run

Click Save.

To trigger the build, click Build Now.

7. View Build Results

After the build completes, check the build status, console output, and archived artifacts.

That's it! Your Jenkins Freestyle project is now set up to build your Java web application using Maven.







You want to monitor a project (i.e., a server or service) using Nagios, and display its status (is it up or down, healthy or not, etc.). Here's what you need to do step-by-step.

Step-by-Step Simple Guide to Monitor a Project Using Nagios
Step 1: Access Nagios Web Interface

Open your browser.

Go to: http://localhost:8084

Log in using:

Username: nagiosadmin

Password: nagios

Step 2: Configure Nagios to Monitor Your Project

You need to tell Nagios what to monitor. This is done by editing configuration files on the server where Nagios is running.

Add Your Project as a Host:

Go to the Nagios configuration folder. For example: /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/

Create a file for your project. Let's say: myproject.cfg

Add Host Configuration:
Open myproject.cfg and add this code:

define host{
    use             linux-server      ; Use template for Linux server
    host_name       myproject         ; Name of your project (can be anything)
    alias           My Project Monitor ; Optional: Description of your project
    address         192.168.1.100    ; IP address of the server you want to monitor
}


Replace 192.168.1.100 with your project's actual IP address.

Add Service to Monitor (like HTTP, Ping, etc.):
If you want to monitor if your project’s web server is up (HTTP), you can add this:

define service{
    use                     generic-service        ; Use default service template
    host_name               myproject             ; Name of your project
    service_description     HTTP                  ; Service name (e.g., "HTTP" for web server)
    check_command           check_http            ; Command to check if HTTP is up
}

Step 3: Restart Nagios to Apply the Changes

Once you've added the host and service configurations, restart Nagios to apply those changes:

# Restart Nagios
sudo systemctl restart nagios

Step 4: Check the Status on the Web Interface

Go back to your browser.

In Nagios Web Interface (http://localhost:8084), check the status of your project.

You should see your project listed there.

If HTTP is up, it will show as "OK."

If it's down, it will show as "CRITICAL" or "DOWN."

Step 5: Verify Status via Command Line

If you want to verify manually, you can run this on your Nagios server:

# Check if the HTTP service is up for your project
sudo /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_http -H 192.168.1.100


This will tell you if the HTTP service is up or down.
