2. Create a New Freestyle Project

In Jenkins, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project and give it a name (e.g., MyJavaAppBuild).

Click OK.

3. Configure Source Code Management

Under Source Code Management, select Git (or your preferred version control system).

Enter the repository URL of your Java web application project.

If necessary, provide credentials for the repository.

4. Add Build Step to Invoke Maven

Under Build, click Add build step.

Select Invoke top-level Maven targets.

In the Goals field, type clean install (or your desired Maven goals).

Make sure the Maven version is correct (you may need to configure the Maven installation in Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration).

5. Configure Post-build Actions (Optional)

If you want to archive the build artifacts, click Add post-build action.

Select Archive the artifacts and specify the path to the .war file (e.g., target/*.war).

6. Save & Run

Click Save.

To trigger the build, click Build Now.

7. View Build Results

After the build completes, check the build status, console output, and archived artifacts.

That's it! Your Jenkins Freestyle project is now set up to build your Java web application using Maven.






Step 1: Install Nagios and Plugins

First, make sure Nagios and the necessary plugins are installed on your server. You can do this by running:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nagios3 nagios-plugins-basic

Step 2: Access Nagios Web Interface

Nagios provides a web interface to view your monitoring status.

Open your web browser and go to:
http://<your-server-ip>/nagios3

Login with the default username/password:

Username: nagiosadmin

Password: nagiosadmin (you can change this later)

Step 3: Create a Configuration File for Your Project

You’ll need to define the host and services you want to monitor in a configuration file.

Navigate to Nagios config directory:

cd /etc/nagios3/conf.d/


Create a new configuration file for your project (e.g., my_project.cfg):

sudo nano my_project.cfg


Define the Host:
Add the following in the file to define the server you're monitoring:

define host {
  use         linux-server
  host_name   my_project
  address     192.168.x.x   # Replace with your project's IP
}


Define the Service:
Next, define a service (for example, monitoring HTTP):

define service {
  use                     generic-service
  host_name               my_project
  service_description     HTTP
  check_command           check_http
}

Step 4: Check Nagios Configuration

Before restarting Nagios, it's important to check that there are no syntax errors in your configuration:

sudo nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg


If you see no errors, proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Restart Nagios

Restart the Nagios service to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart nagios3

Step 6: Check Your Project in the Web Interface

Go back to the Nagios web interface (http://<your-server-ip>/nagios3) and log in. You should now see your "my_project" host and its associated service (e.g., HTTP).
